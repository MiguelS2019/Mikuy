                <p>Of the nearly 26.6 tons of fruits and vegetables produced each year in Peruvian soil, around 12.8 million 
                never reach markets or homes. When analyzing the supply chain of food, we realized that an average of 47.6% of the 
                country’s annual food production is lost, which places us among the Latin American countries with the highest rates of 
                food waste and losses. We identified that this degradation process occurs mainly due to the oxidation of the fruits and 
                the opportunistic fungi during the transportation process. <br>This problem represents a challenge for environmental 
                sustainability and also affects our population in different ways. Farmers and distribution companies receive less income 
                by not taking advantage of all the production. Likewise, the precarious state of the supply chain in remote areas of the 
                country exacerbates the already existing problem of malnutrition. To help mitigate this problem, various technologies are 
                used to help keep food fresher for longer, such as chemical preservatives, which can have adverse health effects in high 
                concentrations. An alternative is refrigeration, which tends to be expensive and difficult to access. In this sense, as a 
                research team, Mikuytec seeks to aid in the development of the agro-export sector that represents one of the largest 
                economic sectors in the country which could greatly benefit from biotechnology.</p>

                <p>MikuyTec’s main objective is to reduce the amount of fruit and vegetable losses in transport and distribution 
                    stages by extending the shelf life of fruits and vegetables. We propose a large-scale recombinant production of 
                    antifungal and antioxidant peptides for application in a coating applied to these fruits. This would slow down 
                    the deterioration of food and its effects in different areas. At a nutritional level, it would improve food safety 
                    and improve access to quality food in remote communities. At an environmental level, it would contribute to 
                    environmental sustainability in matters of land and water, and reduction of the carbon footprint. And finally, 
                    from an economic approach, it would be possible to increase income for producers and distribution companies. 
                    <br><br>
                    In order to speed up the research process, we focused on three types of fruits, based on their rates of 
                    deterioration and their cultural value in Peru: strawberries (Fragaria ananassa), tomatoes (Solanum lycopersicum) 
                    and aguaymanto (Physalis peruviana). At least two causes for the deterioration of these products were identified. 
                    One of these causes is fungal contamination, with Aspergillus spp, Penicillium spp. and Botrytis cinerea as the 
                    most predominant in these crops. The mechanism of action of our target fungi is the release of mycotoxins for the 
                    degradation of the external and internal tissue of the fruit. On the other hand, oxidation is another of the main 
                    factors of decomposition. Oxidation occurs due to the action of tyrosinase enzyme, responsible for the enzymatic 
                    browning of food.</p>

                <p>
                    To achieve the antioxidant and antifungal activity of the product, the team decided to design two cassettes. 
                    Both consist of the strong constitutive promoter J23104, to increase production of peptides in the bioreactor and 
                    optimize resource consumption. Likewise, the T7 terminator will be used due to its extensive characterization in 
                    the iGEM database. The first cassette codes for antifungal peptides to which a protein domain is added to improve 
                    the specificity of action towards fungi. This extra sequence is a chitin binding domain (CBD) and its main function
                    is to facilitate the binding of antifungal peptides to the fungi of interest. <br><br>It does this by generating an 
                    affinity tag towards the fungal membranes’ chitins, so that the peptides can degrade them. The peptides chosen
                    are: Rs-AFP2, PAF26/PAF32 and Mj AMP2, which have antifungal activity against Aspergillus sp, Penicillium sp. and 
                    Botrytis cinerea respectively. On the other hand, the second cassette will synthesize the VS14 peptide, an 
                    antioxidant whose function is to inhibit the tyrosinase enzyme, responsible for fruit oxidation. Since it does not
                    require any particular binding to the fungi, this coding sequence will not have the CBD. Finally, the chosen 
                    chassis is E. coli BL21 due to its extensive characterization for recombinant protein production and because it is
                    not affected by the peptides produced.
                    <br><br>
                    For production, a Batch-type bioreactor will be employed, providing with the appropriate conditions for the growth 
                    of E.Coli colonies in order to generate high concentrations of the peptides that will be extracted from the 
                    bioreactor by lysing the cells through centrifugation, and then lyophilized into powder for delivery to fruit 
                    and vegetable distribution companies. This powder can be later dissolved in water so that the peptides regain 
                    their activity and can be sprayed on the crops. In this way, the antifungal and antioxidant action will be 
                    achieved in the sprayed fruit, extending its shelf life and protecting it during the transportation process 
                    without the need of chemical preservatives.
